    <p>In __all__ browsers, including IE 8, the layout should simulate a "tabbed menu" at the top or side of the page, where
      each view corresponds to one "tab content", and only one "tab content" is visible at a time. The user switches tabs
      by clicking on a tab title. _The tab switching needs to be implemented using JavaScript._ If JavaScript is disabled,
      the tab menu is still visible, but all three views are visible at the same time and clicking on a tab simply jumps
      to that part of the page with an internal anchor.
